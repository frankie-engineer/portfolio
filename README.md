# üé• Repofolio
A library for auto-generating a dynamic portfolio from your Github, equipped with repo filtering, prioritization, & demo video properties. 

## Features 
Once you've created your portfolio website using the Repofolio library, you'll enjoy the following features: 
- ü™Ñ Your portfolio website will auto-update when you update a repo's name, description, homepage, or [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) or when you add a new public repo
- ‚è≥ Viewers of your website will be able to easily filter repos to find what their interested in (e.g. show me all repos related to 'React')
- ‚≠êÔ∏è You can **highlight** and set the **priority** of repos so they always show up in a certain order on your page
- üé• You can optionally associate a **video** & **thumbnail** with each repo
- üîß You can optionally add **projects without repos** (e.g. you're not allowed to share the code or you had another career in a past life that wasn't software)

### Installation
1) Install PostgreSQL (for macs install the PostgreSQL app [HERE](https://postgresapp.com/) )
2) Install Python 
3) Install Pipenv `pip install pipenv`  
4) Create a Virtual Environment `pipenv install --python "$PYENV_ROOT/versions/<<version_you_installed_above>>/bin/python"`
5) Install all the dependencies for the Python App `npm install`

```DROP DATABASE repofolio;```    
```DROP USER repofolio;```    
```CREATE USER repofolio WITH PASSWORD '<insert-password-here>';```    
```CREATE DATABASE repofolio WITH OWNER repofolio;```    
you should see output showing that the user & database were created

2) Seed the database: 
```\q``` to exist out of psql
```python database.py``` to seed the database 
```psql```
```SELECT * FROM repos;``` to confirm the data was seeded successfully 
```\q``` to exit out of psql

# TODO: Customize the 'FILTERS' object below 
# ---------------------------------------------
# 1) If you haven't used 'topics' in Github before, skim this article about it - https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics
# 2) Add 'topics' to your repos in Github
# 3) Decide which 'topics' you'd like to use as filters so viewers of your portfolio can quickly find them
# 4) Update the 'FILTERS' object below to mach the 'topics' you want as filters 
#    - 'key' is the how the filter will be displayed on the web page 
#    - 'value' is the 'topic' that is in Github (case & dash sensitive)
FILTERS = {
    'All': '',         # recommendation: leave this filter here
    'Full Stack': 'postgresql', # note: this filter works well for me, since all my full-stack projects have the 'postgresql' topic
    'React' : 'react',
    'Python': 'flask',
    'Back End': 'sql',          # note: this filter works well for me, since all my back-end projects have the 'sql' topic 
    'Algorithms': 'algorithms',
    'Data Structures': 'data-structures',
